# Vessel-Heading-Converter
Converts global compass wave directions FROM to relative vessel wave directions, given the global compass vessel heading. Converts relative vessel wave directions to global compass wave directions from, also given the global wave compass vessel heading. This code assumes the conventions that a wave heading straight towards the vessel heading (head seas) is a relative vessel wave direction of 180 deg and a wave headed straight at the back of a vessel (following seas) is at a relative vessel wave direction of 0 deg.
